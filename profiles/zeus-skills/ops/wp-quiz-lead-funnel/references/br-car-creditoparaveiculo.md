# BR/CAR — creditoparaveiculo.com

## Context

First MGS WordPress quiz lead funnel migrated from Lovable/Supabase into a first-party WordPress plugin.

- Country: BR
- Vertical: CAR / crédito veicular
- Site: `creditoparaveiculo.com`
- Plugin: `mgs-quiz-carro`
- Purpose: capture financing leads, route to SMS Funnel by gestor, then redirect to REC page preserving UTMs.

## Public Quiz Routes

- G001 — `/quiz-car-parcelas-g001/`
- G002/default — `/quiz-car-parcelas/`
- G003 — `/quiz-car-parcelas-g003/`
- G004 — `/quiz-car-parcelas-g004/`
- G005 — `/quiz-car-parcelas-g005/`
- G006 — `/quiz-car-parcelas-g006/`
- G007 — `/quiz-car-parcelas-g007/` — modelo visual FMYBC/SMS (`layout_template=fmybc_sms`) com dados primeiro, card central, checklist, etapas e badges.

G002 is the default route without suffix. New campaign variants keep the sequential `gNNN` slug pattern unless Rodolfo defines a different campaign family.

## SMS Funnel Routing

Each gestor has its own SMS Funnel add-lead URL. Keep fallback blank when all gestor URLs are configured.

Do not expose full credentials/tokens in chat. SMS Funnel list URLs are operational integration URLs; display only when necessary and avoid dumping them unnecessarily.

Routing is validated by stored WP lead status:

- `ok:G001`
- `ok:G002`
- `ok:G003`
- `ok:G004`
- `ok:G005`
- `ok:G006`

For multi-gestor quiz configs, routing should resolve gestor code from the first available source in this order: explicit `gestor_code`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`, `utm_adgroup`, `utm_content`, then slug. This supports traffic URLs where the gestor appears in campaign/adgroup, e.g. `b01fb10c12g05`, while preserving the older `utm_medium=g005` pattern.

The SMS response body should include `success:true` and the expected `list_id`.

## Redirect

Canonical final redirect:

`https://creditoparaveiculo.com/rec-br-financiamento-de-carro-sem-entrada/`

All incoming params must be preserved automatically: `utm_*`, `fbclid`, `gclid`, etc.

Redirect split UI should be business-facing:

- `+ Adicionar URL`
- URL field
- weight field
- remove action
- default 100 for single URL

## Admin UX Decisions

- Normal operator path for new variant: Duplicate → name → slug → paste SMS Funnel URL.
- CSV import is technical/migration-only and should stay hidden behind advanced/details UI.
- Reports should show 5 days/leads by default, with per-page selectors.
- Tables should avoid narrow wrapping for gestor, SMS, phone.

## Known Interpretation

If WordPress records `ok:G00X` and SMS Funnel returns `success:true` with the correct `list_id`, but SMS Funnel dashboard still shows zero, treat it as likely SMS Funnel dashboard delay/cache/indexing/filter/deduplication unless contrary evidence appears.
